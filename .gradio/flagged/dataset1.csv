Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores and inflammation. It can be caused by a combination of factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, and poor skincare habits. To manage acne, it's essential to maintain good hygiene, use non-comedogenic products, and avoid picking or squeezing the pimples. Additionally, topping up on essential medications like topical retinoids or oral antibiotics can help to reduce inflammation and unclog pores. I would recommend visiting a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment plan.",,2025-03-06 13:00:56.099798
